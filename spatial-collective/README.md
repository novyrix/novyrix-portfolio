## Overview

Spatial Collective, a Nairobi-based leader in data collection and analysis, needed a website refresh to match their modern brand identity. The original layout was outdated and suffered from slow load times, which impacted user experience. My role was to provide **technical consultation and front-end development** to transform the site with a modular layout, improved navigation, and a strong focus on performance. I implemented **scalable content blocks** to ensure the site could grow with the company, making it easy for their team to add new content without developer support.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

This project required a blend of advanced WordPress customization and front-end development to create a flexible and high-performing site.

**Core CMS & Frameworks:**
* **WordPress:** The foundational Content Management System (CMS) for its flexibility and user-friendly backend.
* **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF):** Utilized extensively to create flexible, modular content blocks. This allowed the client to build new pages and sections easily with pre-defined components.
* **Custom CSS & Sass:** Implemented for detailed styling and responsiveness, ensuring a pixel-perfect design.
* **CSS Grid:** Utilized for a clean, modern, and highly responsive layout, which significantly improved the site's structural integrity.

**Integrations & Performance:**
* **Mailchimp Integration:** Connected a newsletter signup form to help the company grow its subscriber base and streamline email marketing efforts.
* **Performance Optimization:** Focused on reducing file sizes, optimizing images, and implementing caching techniques to significantly improve page load speed across all devices.
