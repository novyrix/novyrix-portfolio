## Overview

The National Parents Association (NPA) needed a robust public-facing website to effectively engage and inform parents across Kenya. I was responsible for the **full design and development lifecycle**, from initial wireframes to final deployment. The primary goal was to create a clean, modern, and highly **mobile-responsive platform** that serves as a central hub for association policies, news, and events. I focused on creating a user-friendly experience that encourages engagement and provides easy access to critical information.
