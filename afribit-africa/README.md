## Overview

This project involved building a comprehensive informational website for Afribit Africa, a fintech platform focused on Bitcoin education and adoption in Africa. A key deliverable was deploying a **self-hosted BTCPay Server** instance to manage a transparent crowdfund for their community initiatives. This solution enabled secure, censorship-resistant, and cost-effective payments. My responsibilities included **end-to-end server configuration** on a **Lunanode** Virtual Private Server, security hardening, and integrating the server with the WordPress front end to facilitate direct donations via the Bitcoin Lightning Network.
