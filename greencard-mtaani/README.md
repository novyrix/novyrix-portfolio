## Overview

Greencard Mtaani is a registered community-based organization in Kibera, Kenya, focused on empowering children, youth, and women through sports, arts, and education. As their web developer, I was responsible for the entire digital setup, including **domain registration, hosting configuration, and site development**. The primary goal was to create a clean, responsive, and easy-to-navigate one-page website to serve as their official digital presence and a hub for community outreach, fundraising, and information dissemination. The solution was delivered with a focus on **cost-effectiveness and long-term sustainability**.
