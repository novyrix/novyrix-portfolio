## Overview

The National Parents Association (NPA) represents parents with children in schools across Kenya. I was responsible for the **full design and development lifecycle** of their public-facing website, from initial concept to final deployment. The primary goal was to create a clean, modern, and highly **mobile-responsive platform** that serves as a central hub for association policies, news, and events. I focused on building a user-friendly experience that encourages engagement and provides easy access to critical information for parents across the country.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

This project was built on a reliable WordPress foundation, leveraging a mix of user-friendly design tools and robust backend infrastructure.

**Core CMS & Design Tools:**
* **WordPress:** The chosen Content Management System (CMS) for its flexibility and user-friendly backend, which allows the client to manage content easily.
* **Elementor Pro:** Used as the primary page builder for a drag-and-drop design approach, enabling pixel-perfect layouts and responsive design without extensive custom coding.
* **Custom CSS:** Implemented to fine-tune the user interface and ensure brand consistency with the NPA's visual identity.

**Infrastructure & Hosting:**
* **Shared Hosting (cPanel):** Configured and managed the hosting environment, including DNS settings and email configurations for the organization.
* **Cloudflare:** Implemented for DNS management, providing a layer of security and performance optimization (e.g., caching and DDoS protection).

**Analytics & Performance:**
* **Google Analytics:** Integrated to track user behavior, page views, and traffic sources, providing valuable insights for future improvements.
* **Mobile-First Design:** Developed with a primary focus on responsiveness, ensuring a flawless Browse experience on smartphones and tablets, which is crucial for reaching a wide audience.
