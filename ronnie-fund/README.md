## Overview

The Ronnie Fund is a grassroots organization founded in 2006 by Peter and Kathy Wood in partnership with local community leader Ronnie Mwachia Mdawida. Their mission is to empower Kenyan communities through education, healthcare, and sustainable development, offering a “hand up, not a handout.” My role was to design, develop, and implement their official website to serve as a professional platform for communicating this powerful mission and facilitating community support. This includes integrating a **self-hosted BTCPay Server** for transparent and direct cryptocurrency donations, complementing their work in building sustainable agricultural practices, health centers, and educational initiatives.
